This is a maintained fork of [incheon-kim/tarkov-settings](https://github.com/incheon-kim/tarkov-settings), which has had no updates since October 2023 and several unfixed crash reports. This fork fixes:
- Crashes when the NVIDIA display handle becomes invalid (RDP session change, closing NVIDIA Control Panel, monitor sleep/hotplug) — see upstream issues [#3](https://github.com/incheon-kim/tarkov-settings/issues/3) and [#17](https://github.com/incheon-kim/tarkov-settings/issues/17)
- Settings not saving when closing the window with the title bar's X button (previously only saved via tray icon → Exit)
- App crashing on a corrupted/invalid `settings.json` (now resets to defaults with a warning instead)
- Added `EscapeFromTarkovArena` to the default monitored process list — see upstream issue [#23](https://github.com/incheon-kim/tarkov-settings/issues/23)

## [->**DOWNLOAD Latest**<-](https://github.com/imda564/tarkov-settings-fixed/releases/latest)

Automatically change color settings for [Escape from Tarkov](https://escapefromtarkov.com).

## How it works?
- Changes Digital Vibrance value from Nvidia Settings using [NvAPIWrapper](https://github.com/falahati/NvAPIWrapper)
- Changes Gamma using some [Win32 API calls](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/wingdi/nf-wingdi-setdevicegammaramp)

It only changes your display's colors when Escape from Tarkov's window is in focus.
This leaves a smooth transition when minimizing/maximizing.

## Supported Graphic Cards
- Nvidia GPU **fully supported.** (Brightness/Contrast/Gamma/Saturation)
- AMD GPU **partially supported.** (Except Saturation)
- **Intel/Etc is not supported yet.**

## What does it do?
You can change any of the following color settings:
1. Brightness
2. Contrast
3. Gamma
4. Digital Vibrance Control (aka. Saturation)
5. Only affects display while EFT window is focussed (It also prevents **sudden flash during Alt-tabbing**)

## How to Use
1. Open application (SmartGuard might prevent opening as it's not signed)
2. Set any color value
2.1. Double-click any slider labels to reset their values.
3. Minimize and play EFT
4. Close application if you want to deactivate

**Settings are saved to `settings.json` whenever you close the window or exit from the tray icon.**

## Warning
1. It might blink couple times when you active EFT window but it works. Don't worry.
2. **Disclaimer: I don't know BSG will ban for using this.**
3. AMD only supports Brightness/Contrast/Gamma Controls
4. Intel Graphic Cards are not supported
5. Only works in **Borderless mode.**
6. Nvidia Optimus Environment (mostly laptops) is not tested.
